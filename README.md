Razavi-bench packages the question-answer assessments from Behzad Razavi's
*Analog Design Experiments With AI* Part 1 and Part 2 into a clean
one-task-per-directory benchmark. The tasks probe whether a model can reason
about MOS devices, small-signal circuits, feedback, oscillators, comparators,
dividers, LNAs, TIAs, and LC oscillators.

Each task directory keeps only the benchmark prompt, figure, and curated golden
answer. Cleaned public AI model outputs are stored separately under
`experiments/` so the task definitions remain independent from any model run.

## At a Glance

| Part 1 | 30 questions, Q1-Q30 |
| Part 2 | 20 questions, Q1-Q20 |
| `task.toml` files | 0 |
| Source PDFs | Not tracked |

Top-level files:

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `evaluation_rubric.md` | 0-4 evaluation guide used by judge scripts |
| `experiments/` | Cleaned model outputs and per-experiment metadata |
| `tools/` | Reproducible judge scripts for scoring model outputs |
| `LICENSE` | License, source, and permission terms |

## Task Format

Each `instruction.md` contains only the benchmark prompt and any local figure
reference. It intentionally excludes source metadata, original model answers,
scores, and explanatory commentary.

Each `golden_solution.md` contains the expected reasoning and final answer for
evaluation. The golden answers were reviewed against the source articles,
figures, and circuit analysis.

## Experiments

`experiments/` contains cleaned model outputs and per-experiment metadata. The
`2026-06-26-direct-qa` experiment includes GPT, Gemini, and Claude
question-answer pairs from the direct-mm-v4-newgolden benchmark release. The
public files exclude system prompts, process
instructions, hidden reasoning, Vela session IDs, provider metadata, token/cost
data, and internal record IDs.

Automated judge scores, when present, are experiment metadata for transparency
and re-grading. They are not a substitute for independent expert review, and
new judge runs can be added if the rubric or golden answers change.

The judge scripts in `tools/` read API keys from environment variables or
interactive input. They do not store credentials in the repository.

The benchmark includes or adapts source questions and figures from Behzad
Razavi's *Analog Design Experiments With AI* articles with permission from

their respective rights holders, including Behzad Razavi and/or IEEE, as

## Notes

The user request originally mentioned 40 questions for Part 1, but the available
Part 1 article contains Q1 through Q30. No synthetic questions were added.
