# Experiment: 2026-06-26 direct-qa

This directory contains cleaned AI question-answer pairs from one Razavi-Bench
experiment.

## Experiment

- Run date: 2026-06-26
- Benchmark release: direct-mm-v4-newgolden
- Models: GPT-5.5 Thinking XHigh, Gemini 3.1 Pro CC Thinking High, Claude Opus
  4.8 Thinking Max
- Rollouts: 3 per model
- Records: 450 total, stored as 9 model-output JSONL files

## Files

- `model_outputs/`: cleaned GPT, Gemini, and Claude answer JSONL files, split
  by model family and rollout.
- `judge_outputs/`: per-answer judge model output JSONL files.
- `judge_scores/summary.csv`: rollout-aware aggregate score table for reports
  and plots.
- `tools/`: scripts used to generate `judge_outputs/*.jsonl`.
- `figures/`: MiniMax and DeepSeek score plots generated from
  `judge_scores/summary.csv`.

Each `model_outputs/*.jsonl` line is one JSON object with the effective
benchmark question, final visible model answer, run date, rollout number,
answer round count, model call count, and internet/tool evidence flag.
There are 9 files: 3 model families times 3 rollouts, with 50 records each.

The model output files exclude system prompts, process instructions, hidden
reasoning, Vela session IDs, provider metadata, token/cost data, and internal
record IDs.

`internet_or_tool_evidence` is `false` for every record in this experiment. The
original audit checked exposed tools/functions, structured tool calls, and
web-search request counters.

Judge outputs are stored separately under `judge_outputs/` because they are tied
to the rubric and golden answers used at judge time. If the rubric or golden
answers change, add a new judge output artifact under this experiment rather
than modifying the cleaned model output files.

`judge_scores/summary.csv` is derived from the judge outputs and keeps
model-family, rollout, judge-family, and Part 1/Part 2/overall aggregates. Use
it as the single summary source for reports and plots; use `judge_outputs/*.jsonl`
when per-answer scores and rationales are needed.

The judge scripts read API keys from environment variables or interactive input.
They do not store credentials in the repository.

Examples:

```bash
python3 experiments/2026-06-26-direct-qa/tools/run_minimax_judge.py \
  --output-name minimax-m3-part1-001 \
  --task-slug part1-001-double-length-and-width-mosfet-its-intrinsic

python3 experiments/2026-06-26-direct-qa/tools/run_deepseek_judge.py \
  --output-name deepseek-gpt-r1-part1-001 \
  --task-slug part1-001-double-length-and-width-mosfet-its-intrinsic \
  --model-family gpt \
  --rollout 1
```

Generate the judge-score plots:

```bash
python3 experiments/2026-06-26-direct-qa/tools/plot_scores.py
```

This writes `figures/judge_scores_minimax.*` and
`figures/judge_scores_deepseek.*`. The bars show rollout means, black lines
show rollout min-to-max, and colored dots show the three rollout aggregates.

Regenerate the summary table before plotting:

```bash
python3 experiments/2026-06-26-direct-qa/tools/plot_scores.py --rebuild-summary
```
